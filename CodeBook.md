Study Design

Data were taken from Experiment: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset at : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Data was then manipulated to extract variables with summary measures of mean and standard deviations for final dataset
This codebook describes the variables included in the dataset:
